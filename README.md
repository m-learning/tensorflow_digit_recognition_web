MNIST Digit Recognition
==========================

Digit recognition application trained on **MNIST** thru _TensorFlow_ framework

# Use it!
=========

To run application you need to install [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) on your machine

One can download it from official web site or install via `pip install Flask` command by _pip_. 

For _TensorFlow_ visit the [TensorFlow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation) and `apt get install opencv` for _OpenCV_ on _Ubuntu_

If you have already installed all dependencies then just move to project directory and run `python  -m cnn.mnist.cnn_controller` (or `python -m cnn.mnist.cnn_controller <host> <port>` to bind on specific host and port) then open web browser and copy [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in it

Enjoy :smile:
