MNIST Digit Recognition
==========================

Digit recognition application trained on **MNIST** thru _TensorFlow_ framework

# Use it!
=========

To run application you need to install [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) on your machine

One can download it from official web site or install via `pip install Flask` command by _pip_ the same for _TensorFlow_ and _OpenCV_

If you have already installed all dependencies then just move to project directory and run `python  cnn/mnist/cnn_controller.py` (or `python -m cnn/mnist/cnn_controller.py <host> <port>` to bind on specific host and port) then open web browser and copy [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in it
